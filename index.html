				<h1>Hello, I'm Lucas 😄</h1>

				<p> 
				I love politic, guitar and video games. I have a project to make an ASMR application that links relaxation to sleep called <strong>Brill</strong> 🎧.
				<br> Below this link to see my 1 minute video explaining the concept of my app in French <img src="flag-france_1f1eb-1f1f7.png" height="18" width="18"> :)

				<h2>Politic 👨‍💼</h2>
				<p>
				I am really passionate about the world of politics, and by the way, I have already been in <strong>politic</strong> : I was named <strong>24th co-lister</strong> on an electoral list during the 2020 municipal elections in Paris, and thus, I have been recognized as the <strong>youngest co-lister in France</strong>.

				<h3>Guitar 🎸</h3>
				<p>
				I really like the <strong>guitar</strong>, because it's a bit of a way to express myself without using words, and I've been doing it for <strong>7 years</strong>.

				<h4>Video games 🎮</h4>
				<p>
				I have loved video games since I was little. I've been playing games like <strong>League of Legends</strong> or <strong>Rocket League</strong> a lot for 4 years, this time it's a bit of a way for me to escape and de-stress. By the way, I train in order to have a sufficient level to be able to start <strong>competitions</strong> (of course it's still a passion 😅)
